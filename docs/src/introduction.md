# Introduction

`jen` is a fast project generation tool based on Tera templates. Its power comes from two features:

1) **Template files:** Projects can contain template files that get populated with variables during the creation process.

2) **Features:** Templates can declare a set of features that a user can opt-in to. Features are capable of conditionally including new files.
